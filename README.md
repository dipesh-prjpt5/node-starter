# Node Go-To ðŸš€

This repository is a **Node.js starter template** that I use as a base for all my new Node.js projects.  
It comes with a simple Express server, dotenv setup for environment variables, and a clean folder structure.

## Features
- Express server setup

- Basic project structure for scalability
- Ready to extend for APIs, authentication, and databases
