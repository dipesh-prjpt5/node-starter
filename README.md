# Node Go-To ðŸš€

This repository is a **Node.js starter template** that I use as a base for all my new Node.js projects.  
It comes with a simple Express server, dotenv setup for environment variables, and a clean folder structure.

## Features

- Express server setup
- Environment variable support with dotenv
- Basic project structure for scalability
- Ready to extend for APIs, authentication, and databases

## Usage

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dipesh-prjpt5/node-starter.git my-new-project
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Create a .env file in the root directory and add your environment variables. For example:
   ```bash
   PORT=5000
   ```
4. Start the server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
